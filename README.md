# Mover Mini "Unicode Stickers" Sample

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to add Mover Mini to an application. In this application, each user has a "sticker" with a Unicode character on it; which sticker each user has depends on his device. The only way you can get other stickers is by trading them with nearby users â€” through Mover Mini.

You can get [Mover Mini at its own repository](http://github.com/millenomi/mover-mini-binaries) if you want to try it out.

The following are demonstrated in this sample:

 * Initializing Mover Mini.
 * Showing the Mover table.
 * Having Mover transfer a sticker and receiving it.
 * Displaying a sticker with a custom image and title on the Mover table.
