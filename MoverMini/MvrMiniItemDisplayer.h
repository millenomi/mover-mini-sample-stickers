/** An item displayer produces information that a table (a MvrTable instance) uses to decorate that item's visual representation (the slide). For example, it produces the title and icon that are shown on the slide.
 
 You can create your own displayers for your own types. To do so, create a subclass and override (at a minimum) #displayableItemTypes and #imageOfSize:forItem:, though this assumes that you'll use default implementations for all other methods. Check up on the documentation for these methods to see what to override for more advanced functionality.
 
 Once you have created your own displayer class, you have to register an instance of it using the #addDisplayer: method (or the convenience #addDisplayer method, which creates one instance for you) before table instances will be able to use it.
 
 There is a default item displayer that produces a generic ("package") icon, which is returned for items for which no displayer is registered. Mover Mini also provides a UIKit-powered displayer for images which is not set up by default, but can be used if you want to transfer images; see the @ref MvrMiniImageDisplayer class for more information.
