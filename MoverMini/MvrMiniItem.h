 An item represents a block of data and metadata that can be transferred by the Mover engine over the network. You construct one from a file or a NSData object, and then pass it to the MvrTable object to let the user see it (as a slide on the table) and pass it to another host.

/**
 Returns all the metadata this object was created with. A metadata dictionary is composed of string keys associated to string values only.
 
 A couple of restrictions apply to the metadata you can add to an item. Keys with the following prefixes are forbidden and may be overwritten by the Mover engine if you use them:
 
 - All keys starting with "Payload-", which are reserved for use by the transport protocol.
 - All keys starting with "Mvr", which are reserved for use by the Mover engine.
 
 As a partial exception, certain Mover engine keys starting with "Mvr" have their own constants (for example, the key you retrieve through the @ref kMvrMiniItemOriginalFilenameKey constant). You are allowed to use those keys, and they won't be overwritten by the engine.
 
 You are able to use metadata keys with any other prefix for your own private use. Metadata is transferred and saved alongside the item when it's passed between Mover Mini clients and the Mover application, but does not remain saved if the item is sent to the Mover Connect desktop application, so take care if you accept items coming from the desktop client.

 Returns a path to a file containing the item's contents. Calling this path triggers the internal machinery of the item to save its contents if it hasn't saved to disk already, so do not call this method unless absolutely necessary.
 
 This path may be the path you constructed the item with (if you did so by calling #itemWithContentsOfFile:title:type:userInfo:error:). Otherwise, it may be a path to a temporary location on disk, unless you have made the item persistent (by calling #makePersistentByMovingToPath:error:).

A temporary item is created when data is received over the network; in this case, the data will be destroyed when the item object is deallocated.

On the other hand a persistent object will not modify the file returned by the #path property and the file will keep existing past deallocation; a persistent item will never modify the data on disk, but may refer to it for reading only.
 
 You may be able to create temporary items in some cases, for example when using the #itemWithData:title:type:userInfo: method; additionally, items received from the network that you haven't saved explicitly are always temporary. You can make a temporary item persistent by moving the data to a known location you control with the #makePersistentByMovingToPath:error: method.
